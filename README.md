## Presentation
Written in 2008 using [BlitzMax](https://blitzmax.org) in collaboration with two graphics designers named Pikila et Willow, that game is about Michael, a friendly pig on a mission to take down the Evil Shoes Empire. The name *Manic Michael* is in relation to a kind of video games called *manic shooters* where the player has to dodge a considerable amount of bullets on the screen while frantically smashing the Fire button of his gamepad.

## How to play

### Starting the game

On Windows, run one of the *manic_michael-win32* EXE files depending on your desire to go fullscreen or not.

Same thing on OS X, with *manic_michael-osx*.

### Controls

Michael can be controlled using the keyboard or a joystick. Here are the key mapping for keyboard players:

- UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT: move Michael in the same direction as the arrow key pressed,
- SPACE: shoot (keep the key pressed for autofire),
- B: drop a bomb. You only have one, it kills all the enemies on the screen.

The more enemies you kill, the more the games throw at you, so be careful with the bomb as it will unleash a big wave of enemies upon you.

Also, your score is influenced by how close to the right border of the screen you are when shooting enemies: the closer, the better as you get more points per kill.

The game has no sound.

Press ESC to quit the game.
